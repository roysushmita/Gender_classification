# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying gender (male or female) from image data. The classification is achieved through the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning, a technique that leverages pre-trained models for feature extraction and classification tasks.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of images, each associated with a gender label. The dataset was curated and preprocessed for the purpose of gender classification.

# Methodology
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are utilized to extract relevant features from the images and perform the gender classification task. The architecture of the CNN model, including the number of layers, activation functions, and pooling techniques, is described in the code.

- Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is employed to leverage pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, or Inception. This approach allows us to benefit from models that have already learned rich features from large image datasets. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on our specific gender classification task.
