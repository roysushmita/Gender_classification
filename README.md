# Overview
This repository contains a deep learning project that focuses on classifying gender (male or female) from image data. The classification is achieved through the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning, a technique that leverages pre-trained models for feature extraction and classification tasks.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a folder containing the images and an accompanying CSV file that lists the names of each image along with their respective labels. The dataset was carefully curated and preprocessed to facilitate gender classification.

# Methodology
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are utilized to extract relevant features from the images and perform the gender classification task. The architecture of the CNN model, including the number of layers, activation functions, and pooling techniques, is described in the code.

- Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is employed to leverage pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet or Inception. This approach allows us to benefit from models that have already learned rich features from large image datasets. However, the pre-trained models are not fine-tuned specifically for our gender classification task because the IMAGENET dataset already contains classes for 'MALE' and 'FEMALE'.
